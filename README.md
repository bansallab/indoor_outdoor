## Data
Data on the indoor activity seasonality metric that we define in this work can be found in the `indoor_activity_data` directory. The `indoor_activity_2018_2020.csv` file contains weekly, county-level (fips) indoor activity estimates.

##Analysis
#### Time series clustering
Python code for the time series clustering in this work can be found in the `time_series_clustering` directory.

#### Sinusoidal fits
R code for the sinusoidal fits in this work can be found in the `sinusoidal_fit` directory.
